# Dockerize Clicker

## Description

A simple clicker game about clicking the Dockerize sticker to earn containers. You can use these containers to buy upgrades per click and get passive containers.

## Technologies

This is build in React with TypeScript and Vite. To handle storing all of the data, I used localStorage. To make updates happen in real-time, I used a React Context that fetches all of the values when you do an action or when you get your passive containers. I also used Tailwind CSS for styling.
